# Cod√©dex Holiday Hackathon 2024

A simple recreation of the MTA website as it would have been in the 90s. There are maps from the time included in the repository (source: NYCSubway.org).

Key features:
 - Simple and professional background
 - Clones of original subway maps
 - Original GIFs used in the old MTA website
 - Real information taken from the MTA website

Built only using HTML and CSS.

Biggest challenge: finding maps and information appropriate for the time.
