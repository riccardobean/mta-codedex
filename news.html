                MTA Press Release #76
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>MTA BOARD APPROVES NEW BUS PURCHASE</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                The Metropolitan Transportation Authority today approved the purchase of 350 diesel and 190 compressed
                natural gas buses to accommodate the increased ridership on both local and express bus routes throughout
                the city resulting from the new fare policy and the elimination of two-fare zones.
            </p>

            <p>
                These contracts call for 175 diesel buses to be manufactured by Orion Bus Industries, Oriskany, NY, 175
                diesel buses to be manufactured by NovaBUS Industries, Schenectady, NY, and 190 compressed natural gas
                buses by New Flyer of America, Crookston, Minnesota. The agreements with Orion and NovaBUS also include
                options to purchase an additional 175 buses from each manufacturer.
            </p>

            <p>
                "These new buses will allow the MTA to continue to improve service as we move forward with the historic
                unlimited monthly, weekly, and daily passes for riders", said Governor George E. Pataki. "This is great
                news for all New Yorkers and great news for the workers at Orion Bus in Oriskany and NovaBus in
                Schenectady."
            </p>

            <p>
                "In addition, this contract will allow us to improve our air quality in New York City by replacing aging
                buses with 190 cleaner compressed natural gas buses", the Governor added.
            </p>

            <p>
                This program, along with the new fare policy, demonstrates that we can improve our environment while
                also ensuring that riders get the services and discounts they deserve. Under the new program, MTA NYC
                Transit will complete conversion of the Jackie Gleason Depot in Brooklyn to CNG by mid-1998. This will
                be the first fully operational CNG depot in the MTA NYC Transit system. Two other depots, one in the
                Bronx and another in Manhattan, have been identified to allow for future CNG bus purchases.
            </p>

            <p>
                The anticipated delivery by New Flyer will be in mid-to-late 1994. Nova's pilot bus is scheduled to be
                delivered in the spring of 1994, with the delivery of production buses to begin next summer. Orion's
                pilot is also expected next summer, with delivery of production buses beginning in January 1994.
